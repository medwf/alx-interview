# 0x04. UTF-8 Validation

## Project Overview

The "0x04. UTF-8 Validation" project focuses on verifying whether a given dataset represents a valid UTF-8 encoding. To accomplish this, you will need to utilize your knowledge of bitwise operations, the UTF-8 encoding scheme, and Python programming.

## Key Concepts and Resources

### Bitwise Operations in Python
- **Bitwise Manipulation**: Understanding how to manipulate bits using AND (`&`), OR (`|`), XOR (`^`), NOT (`~`), and shifts (`<<`, `>>`).
- **Resources**:
  - [Python Bitwise Operators](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_basic_operators.htm)

### UTF-8 Encoding Scheme
- **UTF-8 Encoding Rules**: Familiarity with how characters are encoded into one or more bytes in UTF-8.
- **Validation Patterns**: Recognizing valid UTF-8 encoded character patterns.
- **Resources**:
  - [UTF-8 Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8)
  - [Characters, Symbols, and the Unicode Miracle](https://manishearth.github.io/blog/2017/01/14/characters-symbols-and-the-unicode-miracle/)
  - [The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/)

### Data Representation
- **Byte-Level Data**: Working with data at the byte level and handling the least significant bits (LSB) of integers.
- **Resources**: Covered in general Python programming tutorials and documentation.

### List Manipulation in Python
- **List Operations**: Iterating through lists, accessing elements, and using list comprehensions.
- **Resources**:
  - [Python Lists](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)

### Boolean Logic
- **Logical Operations**: Applying logical operations to make decisions within your program.

## Additional Resources
- **Mock Technical Interview**: Practice your technical interviewing skills related to bitwise operations and UTF-8 validation.

## Requirements

### General
- **Editors**: Use `vi`, `vim`, or `emacs`.
- **Compilation**: Your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.4.3).
- **File Formatting**:
  - All files should end with a new line.
  - The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
  - Include a `README.md` file at the root of the project folder.
  - Ensure your code adheres to the PEP 8 style guide (version 1.7.x).
  - All files must be executable.
