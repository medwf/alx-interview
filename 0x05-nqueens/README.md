# 0x05. N Queens Project

The “0x05. N Queens” project is a classic problem in computer science and mathematics, known for its application of the backtracking algorithm to place N non-attacking queens on an N×N chessboard. This README file provides an overview of the project, including key concepts, requirements, and resources to help you successfully complete it.

## Key Concepts

### Backtracking Algorithms
Understanding how backtracking algorithms work is essential. Backtracking explores all potential solutions to a problem and backtracks when a solution cannot be completed. For more information, see the following resource:
- [Backtracking Introduction](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/backtracking-algorithms/)

### Recursion
Recursion is a key technique used to implement backtracking algorithms. Recursive functions call themselves to solve smaller instances of a problem. Learn more about recursion here:

### List Manipulations in Python
Creating and manipulating lists is crucial for storing the positions of queens on the board. Understanding Python lists will help you manage these positions efficiently.
- [Python Lists](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)

### Python Command Line Arguments
Handling command-line arguments allows your script to accept inputs directly from the command line. The `sys` module in Python is used for this purpose.

## Additional Resources

### Mock Interview
To further enhance your understanding and practice, consider using mock interviews focusing on backtracking and algorithmic thinking.

## Requirements

### General
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.4.3)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.*)
- All your files must be executable
